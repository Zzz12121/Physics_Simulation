##Features
-[Easy]
    - Simple Physics simulation system
        -Ball falls down and bounces back with energy lost and friction
    - Map editor	
    - Mini map	
    - Every simulator is interactive with mouse
    - Parameter adjustments that can quickly see the effects 
        - Fabric's stiffness
        - Friction between the floor and ball in collision
        - The mass, length, gravity in double pendulum
        - The number of edges in n-polygon and ball
    - Display the velocity vector (value and direction) of each ball in collision

-[Hard]
    - Advanced physics simulation(waterball, fabric, collision, double pendulum)
        - Perfectly simulate the fabric's texture
        - Simulate the effect of a ball pressing against cloth
        - Accurately display the effect of water ball bouncing
        - Different effects on the sides and the middle of the water ball
        - Use Position-Based Dynamics to implement the waterball
        - In order to simulate realistically, we add damping to all stretchable objects
